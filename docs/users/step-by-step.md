## Step 2: Select a Pattern

Choose a pattern from the available options. The Step-by-Step functionality is available for a subset of all the patterns in PatternPal. For this example, we will use the `Singleton` pattern.

## Step 2a. Existing Pattern or New Pattern

If you have already implemented the pattern in your codebase, select "Continue work on pattern". If you are implementing the pattern for the first time, select "Implement new pattern".
