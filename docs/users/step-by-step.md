# Step-by-Step User Guide

PatternPal's Step-by-Step functionality provides an approach to implementing software design patterns in your projects. This section outlines the steps to use this feature.

## Step 1: Open PatternPal

Launch PatternPal within the Visual Studio IDE. This can be found in the main menu under `View > Other Windows > PatternPal`.

## Step 1a. Consent to Data Collection

If this is your first time using PatternPal, you will be asked to consent to data collection. This is required to use the Step-by-Step functionality. Click "Accept" or "Decline" to proceed.

## Step 2: Select Step-by-Step

Click on the Step-by-Step button in the main menu. This will open the Step-by-Step functionality in a new tab.

## Step 3: Select a Pattern

Choose a pattern from the available options. The Step-by-Step functionality is available for a subset of all the patterns in PatternPal. For this example, we will use the `Singleton` pattern.

## Step 3a. Existing Pattern or New Pattern

If you have already implemented the pattern in your codebase, select "Continue work on pattern". If you are implementing the pattern for the first time, select "Implement new pattern".
