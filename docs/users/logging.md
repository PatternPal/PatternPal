# Logging System

PatternPal's logging system is critical for recording use data and providing vital insights into your programming process. It enables us to better understand how you interact with the extension and your IDE.

## Tracking Your Actions

The logging system keeps track of various actions you perform while using PatternPal, including:

- Compiling code
- Editing code
- Requesting pattern recognition
- Debugging activities

By monitoring these actions, we can gain a better understanding of your programming flow. This helps us identify patterns, areas where you may face challenges, and opportunities for improvement.

## Your Data's Storage and Security

The data collected by the logging system is safely saved in an external database located on the computers of our university. This ensures that your information is secure and private.

## Your Consent and Flexibility

We appreciate your involvement and value your privacy. We have built elements within the extension to assure your informed consent. When you use PatternPal, you will be prompted to provide consent, which will explain any privacy concerns and request your permission to gather your data. It is absolutely up to you whether or not to engage.

Moreover, we provide you with the option to supply a specific subjectID if you wish. This allows us to track your individual progress and organize the data accordingly.

On the previous image it can be seen how you toggle the logging system on and off. If you choose to disable the logging system, you will still be able to use all functionality. Additionally here you can configure the subjectID that will be used to identify your data. If you do not enter a subjectID, a random one will be generated for you.

## Logging Status icon

For your convenience of the researcher and user, we have added a logging status icon to the main menu. This icon indicates whether the logging system is enabled or disabled.  The following table describes the different states of the logging status icon.

| Icon | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![Logging Status Icon](../images/OnlineStatusAvailable.png) | The logging system is enabled. |
| ![Logging Status Icon](../images/OnlineStatusNoLog.png) | The logging system is disabled. |
| ![Logging Status Icon](../images/OnlineStatusError.png) | An error occurred while attempting to connect to the logging system. |
| ![Logging Status Icon](../images/OnlineStatusOffline.png) | The logging system is unavailable. |
