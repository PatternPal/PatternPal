**Summary**

A user story should typically have a summary structured this way:

1. **As a** [user concerned by the story]
1. **I want** [goal of the story]
1. **so that** [reason for the story]

The “so that” part is optional if more details are provided in the description.

This can then become “As a user managing my properties, I want notifications when adding or removing images.”

You can read about some reasons for this structure in this [nicely put article][1].
