    /* Pattern:              Adapter
     * Original code source: TODO: paste link
     *
     *
     * Requirements to fullfill the pattern:
     *         Service
     *            ✓  a) does not inherit from the Client Interface
     *            ✓  b) is used by the Adapter class
     *         Client
     *            ✓  a) has created an object of the type Adapter
     *            ✓  b) has used a method of the Service via the Adapter
     *            ✓  c) has not used a method of the Service without the adapter
     *         Client interface
     *            ✓  a) is an interface/abstract class
     *            ✓  b) is inherited/implemented by an Adapter
     *            ✓  c) contains a method
     *            ✓        1) if it is an abstract class the method should be abstract
     *         Adapter
     *            ✓  a) inherits/implements the Client Interface
     *            ✓  b) creates an Service object
     *            ✓  c) contains a private field in which the Service is stored
     *            ✓  d) does not return an instance of the Service
     *            ✓  e) a method uses the Service class
     *            ✓  f) every method uses the Service class
